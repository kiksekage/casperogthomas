# casperogthomas

## How to run models:
```
python3 [nearestCentroid/randomForests/perceptron].py [17/18/arabic] 
```
With cwd being "testkode"

### How to run eval scripts:
```
./eval.sh [reg/class]
```
With cwd being "casperogthomas" or the outermost folder in the repository  
NOTE: [EmoInt](https://github.com/felipebravom/EmoInt) in the folder outside of the repository is needed to run the eval shell script. Furthermore, the arabic test results in regression can not be evaluated locally.
